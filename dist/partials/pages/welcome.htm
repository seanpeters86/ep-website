<h6>What is Exiled Power?</h6>
<p>We have something special here at EP that isn't easy to explain. We are a relatively new guild that was formed around the dawn of Blackrock Foundry in this expansion, and we are made up by group of individuals who all share a love for the game and have quickly grown to share a love of each other. We have an absolute blast raiding together, but we understand that in the grand scheme of things, life takes precedence. This ideal gives a certain uniqueness, in that all of our accomplishments have been obtained while raiding just 6 hours per week, by far the lowest on our server.</p>
<p>Our core has been together since our inception and our leadership is second-to-none. We have one of the best websites in the game that we update regularly. We record and post our kill videos and do things together outside of raiding that gives our guild the sense of unity that is often missing from semi-hardcore raiding guilds. When we aren't putting time into progression, we enjoy playing other games together like Rocket League, Hellpers and any other game that may be out, we love recommendations! During the day we stay in touch using a group messaging application that allows us to get to know each other better as people, not just the Tauren or Blood Elves that we control.</p>
<p>If you are reading this and are currently looking for a new home, I encourage you to check us out. We take pride in what we have accomplished and we can assure you that it is just the tip of the iceberg. We are in an excellent spot to hit Legion running and we look forward to defending our honor as the best 2-Day raiding guild on Arthas.</p>
